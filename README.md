# Algerian-Forest-Fires
Hereâ€™s a short description of my project:

In this project, I utilized the Algerian Forest Fires dataset to analyze and predict fire occurrences. I applied data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and inconsistencies, followed by data visualization to explore patterns and insights within the dataset. I implemented various regression models to predict outcomes and evaluated the performance of these models using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error. Finally, I saved the trained models using the pickle library for future use and deployment.
